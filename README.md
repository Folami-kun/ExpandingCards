# ExpandingCards
Very short and precise code. mainly just used and eventlistener, forEach loop , and flexbox on the css end. might add some backround colors later and other little functions to the page. (HTML5, CSS3, JsES6)
Simple frontend demo for collapsed view cards, but click one and it expands.
